I'm Connor Mullins. I'm documenting who I am, what I think about, the ideas I'm building toward, and the preferences that guide my decisions. The through line: how to live well, frameworks for understanding complex systems, art that rearranges me, where the world is going, innovation, and what it all means.

This site is a living notebook. Expect drafts, experiments, and the occasional sharp corner. I reserve the right to change my mind each time a better idea walks through the door.
