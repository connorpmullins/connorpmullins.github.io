# AI Tools I like

## Chat Agents
- Claude
  - I'm paying for this one, so I'm using it. Good for code snippets
- ChatGPT
  - Obviously nice - I love talking to their advanced speech model. It's a great way to flesh ideas out without typing

## For accumulating work
- Notebook LLM
  - Just started using this and I love it. It's an intuitive way to chat about a specific corpus of work and ideas.
  - Their podcast generation is also really neat. I intend to use it to generate a podcast for every blog post I make.

## Coding
- Chat GPT & Claude (Also Cursor and the Copilot)

## Wireframing
- https://app.uizard.io/
  - Seems neat, but not a very generous free tier
  - was simple and fast enough to be interesting see my Collaborative Storytelling post for generated images
- Midjourney
  - Just makes great stuff, not necessarily the best at constructing ui last time i used it, but might be valuable


# Tools I didn't find much value in:
## app.visily.ai
  - AI wireframing / designing
    - Just gave really mid-tier flowchart results. 
    - Maybe it could do better if I prompt-engineered more effectively
    - Check Collaborative Storytelling post for example diagram
