## Is morality subjective or objective?
- Morality is subjective.
  - There are no universal laws that dictate it.
- But there are common moral principles across all cultures.
- The reason for this is that morality is an evolutionary necessity.

## Morality as an evolutionary necessity
- Humans can't reproduce alone.
  - Even isolated groups inevitably collapse.
- Humans are social out of necessity.
- That is the foundation of morality.
- Put simply: morals are the codes that help the group survive as a whole, which in turn allows individuals to thrive within it.

## Important quibbles
- Morality isn’t just about individual survival.
  - We push aside the selfish; they threaten the group.
  - We celebrate heroes who put the group first, even at their own cost.
- Morality isn’t only about the group, either.
  - Individuality matters.
    - Different thoughts and actions make societies adaptable and strong.
    - Some selfishness and ambition creates leaders and pioneers.

## Implications of morality as an evolutionary necessity
- If morality is rooted in survival, it shifts with context.
  - In war and scarcity: the group’s survival overrides individual rights.
  - In peace and abundance: we protect individual life, liberty, and happiness — except where one person’s pursuit harms another.
- Morality extends to the environment and animals.
  - A barren world without diversity threatens the wellbeing of group and individual
  - Animals have moral value independent of our needs
    - Necessary implication of there not being much special about "the human soul" (See Peter Singer)

## Topics to revisit
- What are the axes morality shifts on?
- Do ends justify means? (sometimes?)
- How do you deal with morality on a day-to-day basis?
  - Link to another post (most things shift relatively little in our lives, think hard about them once, then fall back and don't update unless new information challenges the base understanding (rare))
- What morality do we need to organize on a global level (band -> tribe -> chiefdom -> state -> global)?
- How does this impact the way we think about the future?
- How does AI impact this?
