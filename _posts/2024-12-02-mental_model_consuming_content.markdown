## Summary:

It's worth being very intentional about what content you consume. It shapes your world view, which doesn't impact just what choices you make, but _what choices you even consider making_. Ultimately I think this is topic is one of the most important determinants in how your life unfolds.

## Categories of content

- **Passive Content:** This is content that you're largely being fed by society and can "passively" absorb (passive doesn't indicate lack of value)
  - **Pure Entertainment:** mindless, fun, but not worthless - can be healing or help inspire
    - **Background Entertainment:** music or something so dumb/casual that you don't think about it being on while you're mentally engaged in something else
      - This category largely the same as "Pure Entertainment". It's worth calling out that it can be consumed during times when it's impractical to engage with content in other ways. For this reason I don't include it in my breakdown of how to split your content time
  - **Challenging Entertainment:** content that isn't intentionally educational, but is mind-broadening (art, a sad movie, challenging fiction)
  - **Current Events:** Things covered in the news and being talked about by society at large
- **Active Content:** This is content that you seek out, think critically about, and that informs your world-view. Challenging Entertainment can dip into this category.
  - **Content about things you know well:** Deepening your understanding of the things you are passionate about helps provide mastery and competence in life, and is extremely valuable. This is especially true if you share your passions with others. It is easy to over-index on this category.
  - **Content about things you don't know as well:** Constantly learning new things keeps you agile, young, and optimistic about your ability to tackle a changing world. It's worth devoting part of your time to this type of content.
- **Really Active Content:** This is content that requires you to quiet your ego, challenge your opinions, and actively re-think how you see and interact with the world.
  - **Content that actively challenges your worldview:** This involves actively trying to learn things that force you to re-evaluate how you see the world. People are generally pretty bad at updating their beliefs. Being intentional about doing so has massive benefits. I highly recommend Adam Grant's excellent book, Think Again, for more information on the topic.

## How to Have a Balanced Content Diet

### My Target Content Diet

- Passive Content (~30%)
  - 20%: Pure Entertainment
    - Keeping up with my fandoms, exploring new authors and sci-fi classics
    - NO social media
  - 5%: Challenging Entertainment
    - Need to make my way through Schindler's List, Green Mile, Shawshank, and many other greats
  - 5%: Current Events
    - Skim the 1440, keep an ear to the ground about other similar things that could be better
- Active Content (~60%)
  - 40%: Content about things I know well
    - I want to go deep enough on content that I can reference and finish building out all my mental models
    - I want to go to more 1st. party sources (data, studies, and whitepapers)
    - Need to deepen my ability to think about these topics from first principles and ballpark numbers effectively
  - 20%: Content about things I don't know as well
    - I want to continue actively learning new skills and about new areas. I think it's one of the things I'm good at and that helps me provide value.
    - Don't really care what form this is in - it's usually books.
- Really Active Content (~10%)
  - 10%: Content that actively challenges my worldview
    - I want to have a system in place for regularly being forced to engage with this type of content

### My Actual Content Diet (~30hrs/week)

- Passive Content (~35% / 11hrs)
  - 10hrs: Pure Entertainment:
    - Mostly fantasy books and TV
    - I'm still not totally off reddit (1-2 hrs. a week)
  - <1hr: Challenging Entertainment
    - I watch a hard show or movie every month or two
  - <1hr: Current Events
    - I skim the 1440 each morning
- Active Content (~60% / 18hrs)
  - 11hrs: Content about things I know well
    - Podcasts / Books / Audio Books / Blog Posts / Magazines / White Papers About: AI, geopolitics, economics, global catastrophic risk, startups, coding, self-help, cooking, humanitarian aid
  - 7.5hrs: Content about things I don't know as well
    - Podcasts / Books / Audio Books / Blog Posts / Magazines / White Papers About: engineering management, how modern society functions, evolutions in technology, the state of global challenges, philosophy, how to learn, sexual health, killing and death
- Really Active Content (~5% / 1hr)
  - <1hr: Content that actively challenges my worldview
    - I mostly do this in the context of modern events and other hard problems that defy simple mental models

### Your Ideal Content Diet

#### You do you, boo.

- Finding the balance of how much passive vs. active vs. very active content to consume is a personal matter to some extent
- My father once called TED Talks "moral pornography". To the best of my knowledge he's never intentionally sought out content regarding continued continued education, evolving worldviews, self-help, or scientific discoveries.
- Many people are like this. It's not morally wrong to hold this view.
- Life doesn't need to be a constant struggle for self-improvement. It's _mostly_ okay to just enjoy things.
- Not engaging with these sorts of content at all, however, will likely lead to preventable sadness, confusion, and missed opportunities

#### A General Recommendation

- 20%-60% Passive Content
  - If you need less than 20% passive content, good for you. This is mostly here to help you dream, relax, and remember why this whole life thing is worth it.
  - This category can usually be substituted more effectively by time in nature and with loved ones
- 35%-75% Active Content
- 5% Really Active Content

## The News

### What is "The News"

- There's a misconception that news mostly exists to inform people.
  - It seems to be the pre-millennial generations who believe this the most.
- This is fundamentally wrong.
- News agencies (NYT, FOX, WSP, MSNBC, your local news) are for-profit businesses whose purpose is to retain enough viewership to make money from advertising or justify investment from billionaires who want to shape public perception.
  - Some of these agencies do a better or worse job sharing worth-while information, but ultimately they are interested in telling you what you should be thinking about - and their interests are _not_ the same as yours.
  - On a venn diagram, there would be some overlap - maybe 5-10% depending on your personal interests
- It's well-studied that people engage significantly more with content that invokes emotional reactions - in particular with content that stokes negative emotions: fear, anger, confusion, hate
  - As a species our brains are hard-wired to pay much more attention to things that evoke negative emotions. Evolutionarily it was advantageous in staying alive.
  - Now that there are multi-billion-dollar corporations fighting each-other for our attention every waking moment, it's a liability that's being actively exploited.
- Most news groups are owned by the ultra-rich who don't even need to make money from them. Doesn't that give you pause? It gives me hives.

### How to use News

- I recommend spending no more than 5 to 10 minutes per day keeping up on the events covered by news.
- If something sufficiently important happens relating to current events, you _will_ hear about it.
- There's a much much higher risk that you'll miss learning about actually important things while keeping up with "news"
- Subscribe to The 1440 or something similar
  - I get an email each morning that takes me 5 minutes to go through and gives overviews of important events
  - Otherwise I ignore news. If I want to dig into current events, I'll briefly research a topic in-depth using multiple sources.
  - If you find yourself digging into current events often, you're probably not using your time well.
