## Interests:

- Global Catastrophic Risk
  - Why?
    -
  - Read:
    - [Global Catastrophic Risks](https://www.amazon.com/Global-Catastrophic-Risks-Nick-Bostrom/dp/0199606501)
      - Read this back in late 2016, early 2017
      - I've been interested in what problems I should spend my time working since my late teens. I found this book through that interest
      - It also introduced my to Nick Bostrom's work, which has been influential to the way I think about risk analysis
    - [Superintelligence](https://www.amazon.com/Superintelligence-Dangers-Strategies-Nick-Bostrom/dp/0198739834/)
      - Read this back in 2018 after finding Bostrom through his earlier book, Global Catastrophic Risks
      - I think some recent works on x-risk from AI are probably better given all that's happened since 2016, but this remains an excellent primer for the non-technical
      - I credit this book as well as my friend, Jacky, with priming me to pay more attention to AI
