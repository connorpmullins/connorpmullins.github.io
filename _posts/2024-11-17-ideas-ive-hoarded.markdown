## Summary

This is from a note on my iPhone titled "Random Ideas to Make Money and Have Fun" that I've been contributing to since at least 2014.

## Contents

RANDOM IDEAS TO MAKE MONEY, CHANGE, OR FUN

Party game idea:

- Have cards with phrases in other languages on them. Players have to try to pronounce them without messing up / faltering. If they fuck it up they take a shot.
- Make it an app!!
- brilliant.

15 Minute Democracy
"A political app for Everyone"

- create an app that does a concise, fact-based, as un-opinionated as possible, 'daily', 'weekly', and 'monthly' breakdown of what's happening in each house of the government.
- At the bottom of each summary or 'topic', there will be a 'I care about this!' button
- By clicking that button, the item will be added to the user's 'shopping cart' of action items.
- In the shopping cart, the user will indicate what they like and don't like about each thing they care about
- We will then tell them how to take action via pre-written letters addressed to the appropriate people. The user can sign them all with a tap and then sign off
- 15 minutes a day = active participation in our democratic system

Brand myself as a 'product' of sorts, worth investing development into. Ask for 10 hours a week shadowing a manager (or position the company wants to develop in the future), and 30-40 hours working as an office assistant, running tasks, doing printing, sending messages, and learning company structure and market information. Offer to do this job at a cut price (30,000). So by the end of 2 years, I'll have close to 1,000 hours management training and will have spent 3,000 hours learning different functions of the business and studying the market they compete in. By that time, I will be able to serve a high-level function in the company, and will be able to move into a position seamlessly and with a strong understanding of my work team. I will guarantee to work that position for 1 more year for a salary of 30,000 - meaning at the end of three years, my salary will only amount to 90,000, and I will have contributed much more to the company than a similarly-paid employee.

Business idea:
. Shower curtains with pockets on the inside that catch water and keep the curtain from blowing in during a shower

'Feel Bad'

- news aggregator that allows people to up vote things that make them feel terrible
- "Worst news of the day”

Noise Canceling Light posts

- use noise canceling tech, attach it to light posts.
- Possible?

Automated vert. grow hydroponic system

- simply state what you're planting in each tray in the app, fill it up, and let it run
- Use the system that guy I met w/Holle designed
- Prototype with cheap products and use the arduino 'vertical hydroponic farm' project to build an initial comp system
- Gardening for people who don’t garden

Put cameras around the outside of a plane and have a 'vr' sim/360 video that customers could stream in-flight. Looking out windows sucks. What's on the other side?!?

'Smart' text-recognition software (TRS).

- There's a ton of great text recognition software, but it's really hard to interpret certain styles of handwriting. What if we could have users manually input the text of one document and have the TRS learn how to interpret that person's handwriting?
  - I see this being useful in organizing study notes, in going through deceased persons' collected writings, and for pretty much everyone with...

Make a 'Life' game, that grabs events from your life like Facebook messages, texts, calendar events, and anything else you can think of.
It then figures out how to sort these based on what aspect of your life they contribute to or take away from.
You then set up life goals inside the app and we can family the process of improving your life via every interaction you have.
there would have to be some sort of 'to-do list' feature where you can also add goals for the day.
Then make this social, so you can track your friends' progress. Tie this in with Sonder and build a new basis for virtual interactions that's based on mutual improvement across platforms

Make a 'family' app that aggregates families' social media, texts, and pictures. A way to keep close groups close. Make a game as well.

'Dragon Drop'

- think shitty game like angry bird that involves launching dragons at villages and similar scenarios

Truthocracy

- establish a cheap but paid news site that compiles 'true' news then slants in whichever direction the reader prefers. Easy toggling allows people to see competitor's side and view studies and stuff.

On entering a social media app, display four sections with icons related to topics a user has recently talked about. They scratch off the one they're most interested in and get a relevant add underneath. As soon as ad is revealed, allow user to click 'go to app' in opposite quadrant. Potentially much higher rate of engagement?

[Already Done in 'Zombies, Run']
Zombie Run - have a running app that has gps tracking. Before you go on a run, set your route and how fast you want to go.

- there will be a drill sergeant /zombie survival dude who tells your how far behind you the zombies are and shouts at you to go faster. There could also be zombie sounds or something like that. You could also use google maps to know what buildings are nearby and have a 'survival mode' where zombies could generate behind random buildings and you'd have to sprint or something.
  Just a fun idea.

App that allows you to build games on your phones ( check out 4th level)

Build an audiobook format or player that allows creators to attach relevant images / PDFs to certain time tags and show up on app screen a the right time / for the right duration.

Dungeons and Drangons + Pokémon. (Or the other way around)

ABKitchen.com

- build a website that crowdsources making incredible recipes
- based on ‘AB’ testing where you just make one change and compare results
- Have the entire website based around voting on the results of making one change to recipes
- Continually optimize and develop a database of awesome recipes.

Clothes Store/App

- make a website/app where people shop for styles of clothes.
- you have their exact and detailed measurements.
- when they buy a design, you ship them said design in their perfect size
- cheap, workable with amazon-scale sales

Global Catastrophic Risk Prevention Agency

- Create an ‘risk prevention agency’ that all member businesses pay x (~.5)% of net profit to that goes to fund the development and implementation of sciences and technologies that could mitigate the effects of or prevent global catastrophes

My University

- Create a non-profit online portal that open-sources finding and compiling learning resources related to any topic of study imaginable. Have resources displayed as cards that inform the user to the topic, pre-reqs, suggested further learning, and communal eating of the resource.
- Have a ‘my learning center’ where students can see what classes (ie topics) they’ve taken, and what classes they want to explore further
- Students rank their own understanding of materials

Weedies

- weed cereal.
- Our cereal at home has 2 - 4 grams of fat per serving
- Make thc oil strong enough that 2 - 4 grams is ~15 mg per cereal box
- The boxes would be the tiny one-serving size

Bet

- build a mobile betting app using block chain tech.
- Users make and agree to a bet on the app.
- There is the title of the bet
- There are conditions that satisfy the bet
- There is a notification date to remind users of the bet
- Users have the option to select a third party who can arbitrate a disputed bet
- The app is linked to Venmo or something and makes a withdrawal equal to the bet amount from both users
- Neither user gets their money back until the conditions of the bet are met

Favors:

- A lot of people have things they can offer to friends and family: favors, some discounts, items, etc..
- The problem is that what you can offer someone as a favor isn’t always what’s most useful to them at a given time.
- The purpose of the app is to allow people to give, trade, and cash in favors.
- Basic barter economy trade system, maybe implement some sort of tinder UX where you swipe right on favors you would trade for
- App users can rate the favor they just called in, so if a user is rated poorly on the favors they offer, their favors are devalued

Giant flush-to-wall energy-efficient, low-light monitor that streams high res video from either video cameras in beautiful places or plays prerecorded. Price prohibitive?

- Build chef ai that uses machine learning to scrape a database of recipes and make new recipes
- Turn into restaurant?

Write a book or record a podcast explaining the most important cycles in the body and brain - make it really informational and accessible to non-med people. Reference which parts of which cycles are commonly effected by nutrients/diet/drugs

Write a program (node package?) that recursively goes through your documents and checks if they contain a comment section that has the format: /_ NOTES [some ID] ....content _/
. You could then tie those code notes to sections of your readme (again, use standardized label system) and update one when the other is changed
. Throw an error if an id in one place is changed and doesn’t have a corresponding node in the code or readme
. This would be useful for linking to code, but more importantly allows teams to edit one shared page of notes of requirements (or whatever) for a component and have in code notation get updated (or vice-versa)

. Build a platformer that breaks a game down into its constituent parts and creates 10 - 12 variations of each one and finds a way to consistently match them in a randomized way to form a workable map. You could make custom parts (that fit within certain broad rules) then plug them into the level generator. You can toggle which parts or enemies you want included. The idea is you play through different levels to get items. **build this out more** Could we find some way to automatically rate the difficulty of generated maps and drop rewards according to that?

. Create a company that sells different supplement stacks premade or allows users to create their own stacks, tests purity of ingredients, and delivers in pill/bag form. Subscription service. Vertically integrate to cut cost and regulate quality.

. Create a machine learning algorithm to detect breastfeeding cancer. Feed it tons of mammograms (particularly of dense breasts) and have it try to recognize cancer. Train it by confirming whether the people who subm mi itted the mammograms actually developed a cancerous tumor

. Thought Web: create an app that can interface with your phone’s assistant via voice interactions. The app should be able to take what you say, run it through some speech recognition algorithm, then map the output to a database of a bunch of different thoughts people cast up to create a sort of encyclopedia of random thoughts/ideas/etc... Should be navigable via some web-like structure. Ideally people just cast up random thoughts or ideas like I do here. You could have a bash-script-esque vocal interface.

Build a tall shelf that has short horizontal runners (like for pull out drawers) all along it in both sides. This shelf would ship with ~4 shelf-things. They could be placed anywhere vertically along the shelf and locked into place. These shelf/things (from here on out ‘racks’) would have ~3 runners themselves, parallel to the sides of the shelf and firmly attached to the bottom of the racks. We would then sell custom hangers that had metal knobs that slid into the runners on the racks. We’d ship with batches of triangle hangers and ones that have two bars on the bottom that crimp closed with a spring. It’s important that the second type is designed really well to protect the integrity of weaker fabrics. The hangers would have 360\* of rotation so the hangers can be staggered in depth on the racks, and turned flush to the front of the shelf. The clothes would be easily seen because they’re staggered left to right. In addition, we should sell fancy versions of the crimp hangers that have screws that allow you to adjust the space between the tongs when they’re in their resting position. These hangers would be used for larger garments that are typically harder to hang. The idea is a few of these shelf’s could be put next to each other and hold someone’s entire wardrobe and it would be incredibly easy to look through.

Is there a way to write a computer program that has its instructions compiled in a dna-like structure? If so, could you create a program that uses a dna-transcription-like technique to copy the program with occasional random mutations that make it better at passing some ‘didReproduce’ test and then picks the more efficient copies to make future copies from? Probably not as efficient as certain methods of machine learning, but interesting.

There is significant uncertainty concerning three aspects of climate change modeling. They are data, forcing, and model uncertainty. Data uncertainty is likely unfixable [[Update June 25th: Satellites and specialized cameras have been lowering levels of data uncertainty]]. I wonder if forcing uncertainty and model uncertainty might be improved upon. The method I might use is this: Feed all relevant data about pasts climates, organized by year (or smaller increments where possible), into a database. Then set the computer up with as many potentially viable models and impactful variables as possible and let it run through the data ‘timeline’ as many times as possible. Each run through it will go over one of the models and tweak the weight given to variables in it slightly. It would then see what values the model produces for each year and see how closely they compare with the real data for that year.
Through this method the computer could remove models and weight variables to find the equations most likely to help us predict future climate change.

Create a counter in the produce section of grocery stores that prepares vegetables while people finish their shopping.

‘Good Explanations’ - make a website where you create good explanations of things. Each page will have 3 sections: A video, an article, and links to research. The videos/articles will be broken up into: ‘what is it’ , ‘what does it affect/why does it matter?’ , ‘what don’t we understand about it / how might it be improved’

Suction toilet - use suction like on an airplane as an effective first step in clearing the toilet. Cut water waste. All that you’d need is a tiny compression pump and tank.

Is there already a company that organizes shuttles for startups that are too small to have their own? Seems like paying for Ubers is common and stupidly expensive. Make a shuttle company that picks up people from a few different companies to cut cost of door 2 door transport

Create something like spy fall or jackbox that synchronized phones. But have it be fast-paced as possible. How quickly can you synchronize those phones and update browsers? That’s the limiting factor

There is an obvious disparity in the ability of the rich and poor to go to good schools. What if there was a cost-effective way to close the gap when it comes time for applications? See what is being done at top schools and implement a college application preparedness program in a community. Appeal to parents (anthem-level economy at first).

Create a new language based on facial recognition, expressions, and gifs. You use your phone to get a live model of your face, find a way to store and quickly sort that data so it can be mapped to gifs that have been analyzed and have similar facial movements. Alternatively, a much simpler hack would be to read facial expressions, and map that relatively small number of outputs to gifs that have been tagged and shared with that expression. It would easily allow expression of emotion via gif assuming we can access a large enough database. How big is Giphy? Could Sonder potentially implement this? Is it patentable?

Models (or Mental Models) : Have a podcast where you help people create simple, accurate mental models for complex topics. Might like this more than ‘Good Explanations’ item above

Create an app that runs on the entertainment devices in the back of airplane headrests. It will display a window that says ‘bid to upgrade - you will be able to move once at cruising altitude.’ and allows passengers to bid to upgrade seats. Passengers who upgrade will be very happy, the the airline would likely capture a couple hundred dollars per sub-optimally loaded flight, and there’s a defensible position that passengers in first and business class who may be upset only purchased their seat and the perks that explicitly come with it, not the emptiness of nearby seats.
Bidding could close on takeoff and winning passengers will be notified that an attendant will come to help them move soon after reaching cruising altitude. Attendants would be notified which seats to move via phone app and WiFi or some custom hardware.

How hard would it be to build a plane with a door like the one at the cabin of the airplane that could take the place of a mid-plane exit door?
Passengers could unload twice as quickly, increasing reload time for a plane, allowing airlines to fly more flight with less planes. Also increased customer satisfaction. Regulatory issues? Difficulty of retrofit? Who is customer, airlines or plane makers?
UPDATE: they do this in Europe. The planes have this ability, it would require airports creating different loading extensor things to work.

MAJOR LIFE GOAL POSSIBILITY:
Create an organization that works closely with government officials in developing countries to implement infrastructure and policies that enable the creation of startups us and cultures country-wide. It would have to coordinate comp-sci education, venture funding, the creation of a physical location for startups to collect.
Issue filtering pre-idea applicants
Create a training team that could teach people in developing nations the technical skills necessary to start companies. Tap into Silicon Valley retirees to teach? What is the business model? It should probably be a not-for-profit mixed with VC fund. Returns from successful startups go towards funding operating costs and all other profits are reinvested in creating more ‘funds’ or investments. Probably can’t expect 100x returns like in SV, but can we cut down on failure rate? How many investments can we make and break even? Goal is to optimize for number of investments, not maximize ROI. (Maybe won’t work —- lack of incredible talent because those people arguably rise anyways)

Crowdfunding for employees. Instead of raising money, companies or startups pitch themselves to potential employees. Employees scroll through and apply. Key:: In order to get to choose employers you need to be invited. Every employee hired through the site can recommend 3 (+-) friends. In exchange, all employers on the site need to be be highly reviewed (use Glassdoor metrics at first) and (maybe) pay more than average market wage.

Could you have the entire top of a plane be a screen that’s a direct feed to what’s above the plane? Same with walls - damage would be a problem - what could you cover with to protect? Either way, alternative to using VR to see surroundings

Build a fun PvP mobile app where users can make 3-5 moves / turn. Time constraint when picking turns. Combat system works so that once both players enter what actions they’re taking, the characters alternate every action, so there’s a high level of shadow game where you have to try and figure out what the other player will do. Probably better the simpler it is. Maybe only 4 or 5 actions + some type of skill assignment. Just needs to be complex enough for deep strategy

Build a new manga subscription service that’s a cross between bandcamp, croundfunding, and manga e-reader. Readers/Investors can add new mangas to their reading list for ‘x’ amount a month. They’ll only get charged that dollar if the writer a) raises enough to write the chapter and/or b) the writer completes the chapter. Artists will have a main feed that they can pitch mangas on. They can raise money and once they get the full amount they can collect it.

Containerized bike storage in city. Adds convenience and security. Can be placed in. Gas start ion parking lots etc.

Create massive sentiment analysis service that aggregates world media and tracks trends in sentiments like nationalism, humanitarianism, war-mongering, etc.. per country and globally. Create fine-grained analyses per news topic, show history, try to create causal maps, etc..

Make a website where I can easily Mark down things that I do daily / weekly as well as my happiness, energy, etc for a given day. That’s the first bit, then have a section where I take those metrics and map them to happiness on a graph or something similar. Just check what actions most impact my day-to-day wellbeing.

Build an app/website where people can upload a picture of their dog and its name. Store in a database, and do some machine learning to try to predict what a dog’s name will be (based on image & location). Consider generating an image of the average dog given some dog name as an additional fun feature?

Browser extension that filters products from companies that don’t fit your ethics. Compile a database of companies and find a way to map those to product listings on popular web vendors. Alternatively, you could block access to a whole page. Possibly a good idea to list alternative websites if you block a whole site.

Build a cli app that checks your environment to confirm it matches some config file. Use it to ensure devs on the GT team all use the same software, have the same versions, can clear any/all caches, and have easy update instructions. Put it on homebrew and open source it. First research to make sure this doesn’t exist.

“ Bounty Hunter” slackbot for Teams

- Create a slackbot that posts to a team’s main channel each morning with a reminder of what “bounties” to look for.
- Bounties are small modular improvements a team can make to a codebase by inserting them in PRs.
- Once per week/sprint, suggest teams review the bounty list
- Why do this?
  - There are many things like: tech debt, linter changes, and updating coding patterns that can be hard to squeeze into a sprint or dedicate a large amount of time to.
  - A daily reminder of what to look for keeps these targets fresh in developers minds

Dicksit-
Like Dixit but rated xxx

Friendcast -
Each day you can record one short video about a prompt we provide that everyone shares. ‘Today I’m grateful for’ xyz. Other than recording the video, the other thing you can do on the app is watch friends’ videos for the day (once you’ve recorded yours), and comment on the videos. Obviously you need to have some account features like adding friends / deleting account. Use text login. Keep it simple.
I like the idea of using audio only, not video. Need to update above
Prompts:

- something I’ve been struggling with recently is…
- a dream of mine is…
- one thing that helps me stay sane is.. (more inclusive wording)
- My focus for this week is… (rotate this in weekly?)
- My focus for this month is… (rotate this in monthly?)
- A hero of mine is…

(Stuff like this as well as personal growth things)

Use LLMs to auto-translate your casts to all languages of your friends

Create a game for bars:
2-player crane game where the prizes are shot bottles
￼
Each player controls a crane and tries to give the other person a shot.
Cost per play just needs to be greater than average shot bottle cost

——————

Patriots Against the Military [need to workshop the name so it takes a firm stance but is less blanket-statement-y than this one.

Create an affordable brand based on reclaiming patriotism from the military and providing a pro-American platform to support dissent against militarism and the military-industrial-complex

——————

Use Whisper / ChatGPT to create a social story telling app. The idea is you create a ‘story’ (can either be with just yourself or many others).

A story is like a chat, except that what gets sent isn’t what you say, it’s what you prompt chat gpt to say.

Once someone prompts what will happen next in the story, the ‘initiative’ (ability to gen the next section) rotates to the next person creating the story.

Could enrich with midge/dali images?
Could allow for exporting stories when they’re complete?

Train an ML model that generates sign language images from text. Same with speech -> text -> sign

—————————

Dem2O

- make an open source white label liquid democracy app with quadratic voting
- Name is just a play on h2o and liquid democracy
- Interesting: https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/democracyos
- Hard project, but perhaps the most challenging part is figuring out how to white label it effectively enough that groups of any scale could implement it themselves
- Perhaps you could allow for a full port of the codebase / independent running of the platform and also support people having their own implementations on an internally supported platform?

“How I Think About Life”

- create a podcast with the goal of interviewing interesting people on the topic of how they think about life, purpose, meaning, etc..

ML generated scent line based on personal taste preferences (work with Yosh?)

- have people fill out questionnaire about what type of scents they might like to wear and generate personalize
- Hard to sell before people buy - free samplers?
- Auto-gen the names and images/branding for the bottles?
- Give people a whole personalized scent line: spring, summer, fall, winter - evening and daytime

Physical things to make

- nightblood
- Use a llm a microphone, and a 3d camera to create a sword that watches the environment and talks about destroying evil

- Jesus on a cross
- Same tech as nightblood, have it talk to you about the Bible and stuff
- Like a talking bassm

- AI social media

  - Social media where you fill out information about yourself but instead of having an externally facing feed, “you”r AI interacts with other users’ relating things you did to things that they did, identifying shared memories, identifying common threads

- AI Dungeons and Dragons

  - Social Story App
  - You create an account, add friends, and can run campaigns with them.
  - You all join a party, pick a world / time period / story arc to play, create characters, and pick a “dungeon master” ai (they could have different story telling styles (scary, cinematic and descriptive, tough (kills characters), etc..)
  - Then, each day, the characters play a session mediated by the dungeon master.
    - You could transcribe the whole thing, summarize it, put it on a timeline, generate photos of the party’s adventures
  - Throughout the day you could check in on how stories are evolving, or you could just check it out at night.
    - Benefit of checking it out throughout the day could be that you could prompt your character to respond to events in a particular way
  - You create a character by imbuing an AI with memories / permanent memory
  - You “roll” stats for them with a stat generator and store that as well
  - You could also pick a voice for each character and listen to the replay of the session as an audiobook / podcast serial each day
  - Model for monetization could be freemium - 3 free days of stories per week, max 3 campaigns at a time (or something)

- How obvious or stupid is it that

———————

Git-based Social Story Telling

- there are tools authors use that let you store information about characters, setting timeline, events, etc.
- What if you had a get repo that allowed you to create a master branch of a story / world?
- People would fork the main branch and create PR to introduce new elements to the storyline or rewrite some fundamental aspect of the world or characters
- something that might be interesting is taking the format of the git repo and training and ML model to write stories or chapters based on the content of the repo. Maybe it’s like a Jupiter notebook? I don’t know if that’s the right thing but you essentially want to build some sort of standardized way of describing a world, characters, events, and how those events are related to the user like viewpoint and style.
- Then, essentially you have a way of generating stories based on a shared world where people can take it and make their own thing with it and regenerate the story with just some slight change
- The model could be deterministic based on seed where given act as the head commit, and some seed, you always get the same output
- That way you can see the difference of small changes
- It would likely also make sense to generate images to store in the repo as well. This makes sense as multimodal sort of process.

After talking with/chatgpt:
We’re exploring a project that integrates machine learning with a Git-like architecture for collaborative storytelling. The goal is to create a platform where contributors can propose story expansions or changes, which are treated like commits. Machine learning assists in refining these contributions, ensuring consistency and coherence in the narrative. Readers can vote on different branches, potentially creating permanent forks. We’re considering fine-tuning an ML model with specific datasets for more tailored outputs. Tools like Scrivener, World Anvil, and Notion could be used to organize the story elements in a structured format for the ML models. This project aims to blend cutting-edge technology with creative storytelling in an interactive and collaborative way.———————AI Dungeons and Dragons Social App

- Social Story App
- You create an account, add friends, and can run campaigns with them.
- You all join a party, pick a world / time period / story arc to play, create characters, and pick a “dungeon master” ai (they could have different story telling styles (scary, cinematic and descriptive, tough (kills characters), etc..)
- Then, each day, the characters play a session mediated by the dungeon master.
  - You could transcribe the whole thing, summarize it, put it on a timeline, generate photos of the party’s adventures

    - Benefit of checking it out throughout the day could be that you could prompt your character to respond to events in a particular way
- You create a character by imbuing an AI with memories / permanent memory
- You “roll” stats for them with a stat generator and store that as well
- You could also pick a voice for each character and listen to the replay of the session as an audiobook / podcast serial each day
- Characters could also level up and gain abilities. Some of this will probably have to be done programmatically as I don't think AI alone would keep coherency over a sufficiently long campaign given current model abilities. Could well improve in 1+ years
- Model for monetization could be freemium - 3 free days of stories per week, max 3 campaigns at a time (or something)

Throw a snarky chatbot model with a camera on top of a roomba. Have it meander around the house and interact with things it identifies as people. I think it should probably aim for shock value

“Where we all agree”

- show where people all over the world do agree
- Need to: determine the right sets of questions, prevent bots / spamming / ensure 1-person 1-account, figure out how to generate great data visualizations to help vitality and interpretability

The 80/20 School

- A series of articles that serve as a reference for how to think about everything you need to know about a wide variety of fields
- Target it at people like me but 10 years younger
