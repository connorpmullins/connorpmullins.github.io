### What are Mental Models?

- Mental models are frameworks for how we understand aspects of the world.
- Mental models need to be adaptive and update when presented with contrary information.

### How Can Mental Models Be Used?

- Mental models can be used to simplify problem solving.
  - "First Principles Thinking" recommends breaking a problem down to its most basic elements and creating your solution from there
  - Mental models can serve as "first principles", though they can mislead if you don't challenge your assumptions or understand all the forces that bear on a situation
- Mental models help make it easier to be consistent
  - If you formalize the way you think about things, it allows you to come back to what you know and be consistent in a wide variety of circumstances and emotional states
- Mental models can make it easier to change your mind
  - If you understand why you think a certain thing is true, then you should be able to formalize the conditions under which you would re-evaluate your opinions
  - Note: psychologically, this is easier because you're tying your identity / self-worth to the process of improving understanding rather than to a static belief or idea
