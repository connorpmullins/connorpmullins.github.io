## Baselines for this discussion
---
<br>
### Optimism vs. Pessimism and Definite vs. Indefinite
- "Definite" implies things will go a certain way no matter what we (collectively and individually) do.
- "Indefinite" implies what we do impacts how things unfold
- Optimism vs. Pessimism is pretty self explanatory.
- I am an Indefinite Optimist.
  - This is most similar to an Indefinite Pessimist.
- Definite Pessimists and Definite Optimists are both intellectually lazy.
- Here’s the chart for context:

### Morality

- [Here's](/_posts/2024-11-18-mental_model_morality.markdown) a short post about how I think about morality.
- A couple additional points:
  - We aren’t necessarily happier sipping Starbucks and wearing silk than we are in rags eating boiled mash.
    - Our brains and bodies aim for stasis. Pleasure fades with repetition, bringing us back to a baseline level of satisfaction.
    - Economic growth hasn’t increased that sort of happiness in a lasting way.
    - HOWEVER
  - Some traumas deeply impact life quality and longevity.
    - Examples: starvation, disease, war, lack of safety, lack of shelter, dehumanization (e.g., slavery), and losing loved ones—especially children.
    - Most people alive today experience fewer of these severe challenges than at any point in history.
  - When I talk about “making things better,” I mean reducing the second category of suffering, not chasing temporary pleasures.

### The long-term view of history

- The biggest mistake most people make when thinking about where we’re headed?
  - They forget the vast scale of human history and just how much it’s already changed.
- For most people in most places, this is a relatively great time to be alive.
  - Many don’t think so.
  - All evidence (I've found so far) suggests they’re wrong.
  - Obviously not _every_ modern life is better than _every_ historical life
    - But if you got assigned a place in society randomly at birth, being born more or less in the current day and age is your best bet for a good life

## The implications of our baselines

---

<br>
- The reason the relative comfort and privilege of our modern day and age is worth bringing up is not to make people who are having a hard time feel like they should buck up and feel better
  - You're totally entitled to feel shitty, I'm sorry you're having a hard time.
- The reason for bringing up how far humanity has come is to highlight that things *are much better now than ever before*. And we can say this despite climate change, despite the rise of authoritarianism, despite US/China/Russia conflicts, despite the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East.

<br>
## Why even near-sighted people should consider being optimistic
---
<br>
- The more myopic our view of history, the easier it is to say "things used to be better."
- But even if we only take a 30-year view of history, things are largely better now than they were.
  - **Millennium Development Goals (MDGs):**
    - In 2000, the United Nations established eight MDGs targeting critical issues like poverty, education, and health, with a 2015 deadline.
    - By 2015, the proportion of people living in extreme poverty had declined by more than half, from 1.9 billion in 1990 to 836 million. [oai_citation_attribution:3‡MDG Monitor](https://www.mdgmonitor.org/millennium-development-goals/)
    - Primary school enrollment rates in developing regions reached 91%, and many countries achieved gender parity in primary education.
    - Child mortality rates fell by more than half, and maternal mortality declined by 45% worldwide.
    - These achievements demonstrate substantial progress in global health and education over a relatively short period.
  - **Non-profit sector successes:**
    - Organizations like the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation have significantly contributed to global health improvements.
    - The foundation's partnerships with global health agencies have advanced priorities such as vaccine distribution and disease eradication. [oai_citation_attribution:2‡Gates Foundation](https://www.gatesfoundation.org/our-work/programs/global-development/global-health-agencies-and-funds)
    - These efforts have enhanced healthcare access and outcomes in underserved regions.
  - **Economic development in Asia:**
    - Rapid economic growth in countries like China and India has lifted hundreds of millions out of poverty.
    - This development has led to improved healthcare infrastructure, increased life expectancy, and better educational opportunities.
    - For example, China's extreme poverty rate fell from [88% in 1981 to 0.7% in 2015](https://pip.worldbank.org/country-profiles/CHN), significantly enhancing quality of life.
    - Such economic advancements have had profound positive effects on global health and welfare.

## Why the hell does being optimistic feel so hard?
---
<br>
- constant exposure to terrible shit
  - (expand on this)
- We think of optimists as "looking up" and pessimists as "looking down"
  - Totally wrong in some ways
  - Pessimists look up at how disgustingly rich some people are and how little money and opportunity they have
    - There is greater wealth disparity than ever before in history
    - The rich have gotten richer much faster than the rest of America
  - Optimists look down
    - Even the poor in America (making 11.5k/year) are among 10% richest people on the planet
      - ((Site Doing Good Better, get my numbers right))
- The climate is admittedly in crisis, which is tough
  - But the news unhelpfully catastrophizes things
  - And all we hear is bad news
  - There is good news
  - And things can still go very badly indeed
  - And we can fix our problems
  - And I'm so glad more people aren't in extreme poverty

## Deaths of despair and addressing mental health crisis

- Is it worse now than before?
- How hard of a problem is this?

---

<br>

## Conclusion

- It could go really badly
  - I can't do anything about that
- There are many reasons to be over-the-moon about what we've accomplished and where we are in this moment
- Our rate of scientific progress, which drives our ability to solve problems (**the main thing**), is not only still going up linearly, it's accelerating. It might even be about to accelerate exponentially
  - Assuming we don't destroy ourselves (and we impact this how we can), then we're on our way to solving so many terrible issues related to climate change, obesity, starvation, disease, poverty, and lack of access to education
- TL;DR; - if the future doesn't suck, it's going to be _magical_
