## Technology

### Dario Amodei

- Why I pay attention to them:
  - Dario occupies a unique space in the world. He: understands AI, deeply cares about the risks related to it (as best as I can tell), is in a position to do something about the race dynamics and potential "race to the bottom" developing in the field, and doesn't seem to be a bad person. As CEO of Anthropic, he's also deeply tuned in to changes in models, the field, and policy.

### Dwarkesh Patel

- Field(s): AI, how the world works, interviewing
- Why I pay attention to them:
  - Dwarkesh is a top-tier interviewer. He's smart, picks great people to interview, spends a ton of time researching them and what they've worked on, then asks them fantastic questions. His excitement about the topics he covers is palpable.

## Politics

## Philosophy

### David Deutsch

- A bit esoteric for my tastes, but he's got some neat stuff

## Environment

### Hannah Ritchie

- Field(s): Environmentalism, Data Science
- Why I pay attention to them:
  - Hannah is a "specifics-oriented generalist" (I just made that up). She is a thorough researcher who backs up her claims with numbers and a deep understanding of what she's talking about. That said, she also thinks holistically about her field and the world. People like her are rare. Her takes on the climate crisis walk the knife's edge of not under-emphasizing the scale of the challenges we face and not devolving into pessimistic nihilism - in fact she's cautiously optimistic. It's refreshing.
