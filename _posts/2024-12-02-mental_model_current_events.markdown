## Summary:

Paying attention to current events makes sense if your survival needs are met, you're affluent, and not going through major health issues or life events. Most people, however, pay far too much attention to them

### How to Think About Current Events

- People over-consume content related to current events
- This isn't because current events don't matter, it's because you largely can't impact them
- This is how to handle current events in a way that isn't dismissive or wasteful of your time, energy, and emotional well-being:
  1. Hear about it
  2. Determine (independently) whether it's worth learning more about ranked against the other moral & practical priorities in your life
  - Note: news will be telling you that you should care about it, _really_ be careful at this step
  - If it's not worth learning about given your other priorities, ignore any further information on the topic that doesn't cause you to re-rank its relative importance
  - If it is worth learning more about, proceed to step 3
  3. Learn about the topic from a couple sources
  - Try to include a source or two that is typically contrary to how you think
  4. Try to simplify the topic
  - Go back to first principles. [What moral considerations](/_posts/2024-11-18-mental_model_morality.markdown) are in play here?
  5. Form a strong opinion on the topic and hold it loosely
  - i.e. know how you feel and why, but be very willing to change your opinion in the face of new information
  - Note that if you've thought about the topic from first principles, very little will cause you to need to update your opinion
  6. Determine whether there's anything you can do regarding the event
  - If there is not, don't engage further unless there's new information that requires you to re-examine your opinion
  - If there is, take that action, then repeat steps 1 through 6 as the situation evolves
  7. Start ignoring anything that doesn't update your stance on the topic

### A Case Study

- How I engaged with the Conflict in Israel, Palestine, and now more places
  1. I heard about the initial conflicts (compressing the events of October & Israel's retaliation here)
  2. I cared about suffering and war enough that it was worth learning more about the conflict
  3. I read the wikipedia article on the history of Israel, Palestine, and their conflict as well as a couple news sources with different leanings
  4. I tried to simplify - this conflict is super messy. There's no clear moral "right side", both have committed atrocities. So what do I believe?
  - I believe that religion is a bad reason to commit violence. It was true during the Crusades, it's true in the Middle East today.
  - I believe that violence begets violence
  - I believe that civilians should have their human rights upheld
  5. I formed the strong beliefs: I don't care if combatants are Jewish, Muslim, or Satanists. I don't care who started the conflict. I'm strongly against any action that directly leads to the harm of civilians. I support an immediate cease-fire. I support keeping current map boundaries, fair or not, because there's no way to unhouse populations that I accept as morally just. I believe this conflict should be arbitrated in international courts and that any parties found guilty of war crimes should be punished,
  - I also formed a set of criteria that would cause me to re-evaluate my opinion:
    1. Either Israel or Palestine have never harmed civilians and are clearly in the right
    2. There is a humane way to remove entire populations from their homes and there's a strong moral reason to do so
    3. There's a reason to harm civilians
    4. There's some arbiter of justice better than the ICC
    5. God shows up and declares that either Islam or Judaism is the one true religion
    6. Someone brings up something else I haven't thought of or thought hard enough about
  6. I evaluated what I can do about the whole scenario:
  - I can continue to promote peace and encourage people to think about combatants vs. civilians rather than Israel vs. Palestine
  - I can't realistically shape the conflict
  - I can and do donate to civilian protection programs (though I need to re-consider the best orgs to donate to)
  7. I started ignoring almost all further news related to the conflict
